## Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service, such as a telecom company, using machine learning techniques. 
The project employs logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting models for predicting customer churn based on various features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 
- Pandas 
- NumPy 
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Data

The [churn prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pentakrishnakishore/bank-customer-churn-data), which contains raw data of 28,382 customers. 
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of various attributes related to the customers' banking activities. 
With these features, it becomes possible to build predictive models to identify potential churners based on historical and current customer behavior. 
The dataset's size allows for robust analysis and modeling to improve customer retention strategies.
